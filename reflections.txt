ABOUT OVER EXPOSING gameEngine

When developing the gameEngine module, I can't help but wonder if there are too many public functions.
Some of the functions do not need to be exposed beyond the modules, but only to use internally.

They were made public since I'm testing with console log. I never considered setting up a testing 
suite via NodeJS. 

At least no data is exposed directly (if you don't count returns that might not be deep copies). 
The only thing exposed are functions.
