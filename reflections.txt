ABOUT OVER EXPOSING gameEngine

When developing the gameEngine module, I can't help but wonder if there are too many public functions.
Some of the functions do not need to be exposed beyond the modules, but only to use internally.

They were made public since I'm testing with console log. I never considered setting up a testing 
suite via NodeJS. 

At least no data is exposed directly (if you don't count returns that might not be deep copies). 
The only thing exposed are functions.

POTENTIAL Refactored Modules

The gameEngine feels bloated with functions dealing with the players of the game. 
If I refactor this code, maybe I'll wrap those players and their functions into a player manager module. 
And hook that up to the displayController.

In general, I'm happy with the responsibilities of each module. But I know I can break it down further 
to make the code more modular. 

When building the gameEngine, I did not really think too much about what the displayController 
or the DOM needs (as I should be doing). So throughout development I frequently have to add new
functions to existing modules to gameEngine so that displayController can use them. 

Good thing I did not have to modify gameEngine too much, and that my initial console game design
withstood new changes for displayController.
