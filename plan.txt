    Functions:

        Some functions from gameBoard will be called by interface functions in gameEngine.

        // player related
        addPlayer // if game is not run, pushes new player to the end of the list of players
        resetPlayerTurn // resets player turn to 0
        advancePlayerTurn // if player turn is not on the last player, advance player turn by 1. otherwise loop back to 0.
        
        // game status related
        isGameRunning // gets isRun
        toggleRunGame // switches isRun to the opposite value

        // board related 
        placePieceForCurrentPlayerAt // if given position is an empty cell, place a piece of the current player onto it and advance the turn.
        isBoardFilled // returns true if the board has no "falsy" cells.
        getWinningPattern // check rows, columns and diagonals of the board for a winning pattern. 

displayController: module to control the html and interact with gameEngine.
    Webpage needs: 
        
        div for "player cards". For each player card div: 
            
            Shows the player piece and name.
            The current turn's player card is highlighted via html class list property and CSS.
            Has a button making displayController change player name.
        
        div for a button to restart the game
            button will make the displayController call gameEngine.resetPlayerTurn and gameBoard.wipeBoard

        the tic tac toe game board 
            each cell on the board is a button with text content. The button sends x,y to displayController, 
            which passes on to gameEngine to update the game state.

            Button also calls to update the div of the gameboard itself afterwards to display the 
            new game state.

        a div to show game results
        
        change name button >  displayController.updatePlayerName > player
        restart button > displayController.restartGame > gameEngine and gameBoard
        game board button in each cell > displayController > gameEngine.placePieceForCurrentPlayerAt(button's x,y)
