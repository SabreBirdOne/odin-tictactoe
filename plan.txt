gameEngine: runs the Tic Tac Toe game
/*
    Abstraction: 
        board refers to the singleton gameBoard
        players is a list of players in the game
        playerTurn marks the player turn of the game
        isRun indicates if the game is running or not.
            if the game is running, new players cannot be added.
        piecesToWin: number of pieces in a row or column to win.

    Representation Invariant:
        playerTurn must be in range [0, number of players - 1], like an array index.
        isRun is a boolean
        piecesToWin is a positive integer > 2

    Functions:
        
        checkRepInv // checks Representation Invariant of the game engine.

        Some functions from gameBoard will be called by interface functions in gameEngine.

        // player related
        addPlayer // if game is not run, pushes new player to the end of the list of players
        resetPlayerTurn // resets player turn to 0
        advancePlayerTurn // if player turn is not on the last player, advance player turn by 1. otherwise loop back to 0.
        
        // game status related
        isGameRunning // gets isRun
        toggleRunGame // switches isRun to the opposite value

        // board related 
        placePieceForCurrentPlayerAt // if given position is an empty cell, place a piece of the current player onto it and advance the turn.
        isBoardFilled // returns true if the board has no "falsy" cells.
        getWinningPattern // check rows, columns and diagonals of the board for a winning pattern. 

Not all of these functions should be exposed to global scope via the factories. I need to clean them up some time before building the UI.
